=== What is this? ===

icq-mac-export lets you export your ICQ Mac logs to Adium.

Although other ICQ exporters exist, they all use the Windows database formats, which differ in subtle ways from the Mac format. Additionally, they're mostly closed-source.


=== How to use it ===

You'll need:

* An ICQ database
	- Only ICQ 3.4 for Mac has been tested
	- The standard location is ~/Library/Preferences/ICQ/Users/$UIN
* A Ruby interpreter, and gems bit-struct and builder
	- Macs already come with Ruby, and need only to run 'gem install bit-struct builder'
* Adium (optional): http://adium.im/
	- If you don't like Adium, you can just read or transform the XML files this script produces on your own


Running:

./icq-mac-export.rb [--nick $YOUR_ICQ_NICKNAME] $OUT_DIR $ICQ_LOG_DIR


Importing into Adium:

- Setup your ICQ account within Adium
- Quit Adium
- Run the script. Use as the output directory the log directory for the account you just setup: ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/Logs/ICQ.$UIN
- Startup Adium
- Choose File -> Import -> Reindex Adium Logs

Note that Adium may interpret the new logs as AIM logs, but they should still work.
